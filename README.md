# 🛠️ Ubuntu Scripts & Tinker Lab

A growing collection of scripts, setup tools, and command-line experiments as I explore and fine-tune my Ubuntu environment.

This repo will serve as my personal toolbox for automation, customization, and everyday system tweaks — mostly bash-based and Linux-native.

More to come as I tinker. 🚀
